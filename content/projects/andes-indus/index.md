Our project explores the relationship between crime and education across Chicago’s neighborhoods. Using data from the U.S. Census, the Chicago Police Department, and Chicago Public Schools, we created an interactive dashboard that allows users to visualize and analyze trends at both the PUMA and neighborhood levels. By integrating demographic, crime, and education data, our tool provides accessible insights to better understand the challenges and opportunities within Chicago communities.
