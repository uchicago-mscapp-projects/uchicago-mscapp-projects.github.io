This project seeks to identify places where low-income families can afford rental housing within a specified income and a percentage of their income they are willing to spend on rent. Leveraging data analysis and geospatial mapping, it will also explore these neighborhoods' demographic, economic, and social characteristics. The findings aim to provide actionable insights for policymakers and community stakeholders, offering a comprehensive resource for addressing Chicago's affordable housing crisis.
