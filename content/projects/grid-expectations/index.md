This project aims to examine power outages and their association with energy generation sources in the United States. By analyzing the frequency and severity of power outages, we aim to explore patterns in grid reliability and generation mix across different regions and time periods

To visualize the results, we have created three interactive maps (e.g., heat map) that visualize the changes in power outages and storm damage as well as the shifts in electricity generation sources over time. We have aggregated data by state to account for their outage history and their energy production and consumption. These tools will allow users to easily examine regional differences in renewable energy adoption and grid reliability in the U.S.
