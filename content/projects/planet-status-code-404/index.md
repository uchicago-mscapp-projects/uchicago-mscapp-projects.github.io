This project seeks to explore the multifaceted impacts of climate change and its distributional effects on communities across the United States.  We aim to understand how climate-induced factors such as floods, heatwaves, and hurricanes disproportionately affect vulnerable populations particularly in redlined communities. Leveraging data from the EPA, FEMA, Richmond Redlining dataset, Census, and a well-designed Climate Vulnerability Index, we will provide a tool to explore the ways climate change will affect communities differently and how those impacts may (or may not) disproportionately affect marginalized groups. This project focuses on Chicago, New Orleans, Los Angeles, Seattle, Dallas, and Houston, selected for their diversity in climate vulnerability.
