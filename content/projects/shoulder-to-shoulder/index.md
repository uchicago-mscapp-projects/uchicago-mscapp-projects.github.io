In 2023, the United States Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged a profound challenge affecting millions: loneliness and social isolation have reached epidemic levels in America. This growing health concern has profound implications, as loneliness can impact mental and physical health significantly. At Shoulder to Shoulder, we are committed to addressing this silent epidemic through the power of community and connection.

Our platform is designed not just as a tool, but as a community builder that enables individuals to find and connect with like-minded people in their local area. We believe that meaningful social interactions are a key to improving personal well-being and overall community health. Shoulder to Shoulder offers a dynamic space where users can easily schedule activities and explore new places within their city, fostering real-world connections that go beyond digital interactions.

We facilitate a variety of events and activities, from hiking groups and book clubs to art classes and tech meetups. Our goal is to make it easier than ever for people to engage in shared interests and hobbies, which are crucial for building strong social ties. Whether you're new to the city, seeking to expand your social circle, or simply looking to explore new interests, Shoulder to Shoulder serves as your gateway to a more connected and fulfilling life.

Join us in combating loneliness by engaging in your community through Shoulder to Shoulder. Let's rediscover the joy of connection together, one event at a time.
