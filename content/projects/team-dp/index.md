Over the last several decades, cities across the US have experienced drastically different population growth rates (e.g. -9.2% to + 128% between 2010-2019 among cities with an initial population over 50,000). This project explores the economic structure of cities (through the lens of its occupations) and how this structure evolves as their population shifts.
