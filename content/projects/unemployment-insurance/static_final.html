        Among U.S. benefits programs, researchers have spent a lot of time
        trying to understand why eligible recipients don't actually take up the
        benefits they are entitled to.
        <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w10488">Low take-up is severe</a>
        for many programs:
        <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/uisup.nr0.htm">26 percent</a>
        of potential recipients took up unemployment insurance (UI) in 2022.
        This is not a new fact. Since the early 2000s, recipiency rates, what
        they call who receives benefits of those who are unemployed, has not
        changed all that much.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-rosenbaum/CAPP-30239-Static/refs/heads/main/static_final/c1_edit.svg"
        alt="Unemployment insurance recipiency rates are about 30 percent of unemployment since 2000"
      />
      <p class="main-text">
        Why is this? Research has provided a lot of answers to plausible reasons
        why individuals don't take up benefits - people may not be aware they
        are eligible, applications are hard to complete, there's stigma against
        taking government handouts, risk of paying back benefits if you
        mistakenly or purposefully claimed benefits you weren't entitled to can
        be severe. All of this and more contributes. But even just figuring out
        who is entitled, granted as a right by the law, is a complicated
        question.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        Some history on these programs can be helpful. Take unemployment
        insurance. Unemployment insurance was established
        <a
          href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-unemployment-insurance"
          >by the 1935 Social Security Act</a
        >. Although UI is authorized by the federal government, each state
        administers a separate UI program through a state workforce agency.
        Unemployment insurance was originally established to partially replace
        income for people who lose their jobs due to changes in the economy, not
        their own fault. Over the past century, it has grown and changed. Some
        core features have stayed the same though: the program is funded by
        taxes on employers and paid for by the federal government; the United
        States Department of Labor (USDOL) Employment and Training
        Administration (ETA) oversees these programs and provides administrative
        funding to states to administer it. In each state, individual recipients
        of UI must meet eligibility criteria defined by each state workforce
        agency. All recipients (i) must have earned a sufficient income from an
        eligible employer in a specific time period and (ii) have become
        involuntarily unemployed through no fault of their own. For example,
        <a
          href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/uilawcompar/2023/complete.pdf"
          >Nevada's monetary eligibility requirements</a
        >
        are described as "1.5 [times the] high-quarter wages in the base period
        and $400 in the high quarter [or] of wages in 3 of the 4 quarters in the
        base period and $400 in the high quarter [of the base year]."
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        Since each persons' eligibility is based on when they earned their
        income over the past however long and the individual circumstances they
        lost their job, it's hard to know if an unemployed person is actually
        eligible. There's no centralized database with a standardized measure of
        if a job separation is "for no fault of their own." There's also no
        centralized database of the eligible unemployed. The US uses
        <a href="https://www.bls.gov/lau/lauov.htm">survey-derived estimates</a>
        to measure unemployment. With unemployment insurance, the department of
        labor assumes that about half of the unemployed are probably eligible.
        This measure
        <a
          href="https://www.capolicylab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/CPL-Data-Point-on-Recipiency-in-California.pdf"
          >undercounts</a
        >
        some people who may be eligible but only partially employed and
        <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/uisup.nr0.htm">overcounts</a>
        people who might not be eligible.

    <!-- Section 1: Measurement Problems-->
    <div class="text-section">
      <h2 class="section-head">Why don't we measure recipiency well?</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        Why do we not collect this information systematically? There's many
        answers to that questions. One area is really important. Getting
        unemployment insurance is actually a two-stage process, where applicants
        have to file a claim and then claim the benefit each week. Here's what
        applying for unemployment insurance might look like for someone who
        recently got laid off. Let's call her Andrea:
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
      <p class="example-text">
        Applications to UI are generally filed through an online application
        these days. Andrea might would start by submitting an initial claim to
        be processed on the web portal. She'd then not hear anything for a few
        days or weeks while the state workforce agency determined monetary and
        nonmonetary eligibility under state law. This often involves the agency
        first verifying Andrea's income with state and federal tax information
        and then verifying the context in which Andrea lost her job with her
        last company.
      </p>
      <p class="example-text">
        After, she'd receive instructions to file her weekly (or biweekly,
        depending on where she lives) certifications to validate that she was
        eligible each week to receive payment. These certifications often
        include attesting to eligibility criteria that recipients are able and
        available to accept work, that they have accomplished state-specific
        work requirements, and they do not have too much income during the
        benefit year or certification period. All of these criteria have
        specific legal definitions that may not be clear like being "able and
        available" for work. Similar to the initial claim, determinations that
        arise from questions of eligibility can lead to Andrea not receiving her
        benefits for a weekly period.
      </p>
      <p class="example-text">
        While Andrea has started filing her weekly certifications, state
        workforce agency staff are making a formal determination about
        eligibility based on the initial claim information. If they don't have
        enough information they're tasked with collecting facts ("fact-finding")
        from relevant parties, like Andrea's old company. This determination
        includes adjudicating between differing claims from individuals and
        employers based on state criteria. Applicants, or claimants, can then
        appeal any determination on the initial claim.
      </p>
      <p class="example-text">
        Once an initial claim is determined eligible, Andrea would receive two
        letters, probably by mail, that said first she was "monetarily eligible"
        and gave her the amount of unemployment insurance she would receive each
        week. The second letter would tell her she was "non-monetarily eligible"
        to get benefits because her layoff was due to no fault of her own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, she'd start to get her benefits for each week she submitted a
        valid weekly certification.

        Claimants' recipiency changes on a week-by-week basis depending on how
        long people are unemployed, how often they complete their weekly

      <p class="main-text">
        Unemployment insurance policy is often complex in different ways between
        states. It's also different complexity in each state. Each state program
        determines the specific meanings of those eligibility criteria. Similar
        to eligibility criteria, benefit characteristics vary between states.
        Each state writes, maintains, and determines what is in that initial
        claim application. Each state has
        <a
          href="https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/pdf/uilawcompar/2023/complete.pdf"
          >different requirements</a
        >
        for applicants to be eligible and a different process to apply.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        This leads to drastically different recipiency outcomes.

        In the image above, each gray line is its own state. Although the
        federal average hasn't changed all that much in the past few decades,

        some decreasing.

      <h2 class="section-head">Each state is making their own decisions</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        Benefits agencies have control over how policies are implemented and are
        often evaluated on recipiency through federal and state oversight.
        Although recent federal memoranda describe a need for benefits programs
        to reduce administrative burden, state workforce agencies are often
        limited in funding to make changes to programs. Determining what
        investments increase social welfare is a challenge for agency
        administrators, especially when balanced with alternative focuses on
        reducing fraud. Beyond just changing the proportion of people that can
        apply, policy and administration lead to drastically different amounts
        of people that can apply.

    <div class="text-section">
      <h2 class="section-head">COVID changed things</h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        As a reminder, unemployment insurance is a mix between federal policy
        that changes automatically with the economy, state decisions about their
        own las and eligibility, and how programs are administered: if the
        website is easy to navigate on your phone, if navigators can help you
        with your app, if there's enough staff to answer the phones. All these
        moving parts make it easier or harder to get UI.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        During the pandemic, the US made a huge change to how unemployment
        insurance works. Whether this was a valid or effective decision to help
        people in need is up for debate. It does show us at least one thing,
        that recipiency isn't fixed. Due to changes in who was eligible and how
        to show your eligibility, recipiency skyrocketed - reaching above 100%
        of the unemployed population. Some of this is fraud, but that's less
        relevant for the point at hand. This is evidence that you can get more
        people into the unemployment system.
      </p>
      <img

      />
      <p class="main-text">
        Although this seems obvious, it's important to recognize: recipiency
        isn't fixed around 30 percent of unemployed workers. It's a choice that
        states and the federal government has made about how people should take
        up benefits.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        This is changing. In the past few years, the federal government has
        provided guidance to states that they should make it easier to get
        unemployment benefits. These memos and letters have focused on what's
        called equitable access to the benefits. US DOL has been focused on
        requiring that state workforce agencies allow “the consistent and
        systematic fair, just, and impartial treatment of all beneficiaries of,
        applicants to, and participants in the UI program” (U.S. Department of
        Labor, 2023). These mandates aren’t just an extra requirement. A lot of
        money was made available after the COVID-19 pandemic for state workforce
        agencies to respond to these concerns:
        <a
          href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/advisories/unemployment-insurance-program-letter-no-23-21"
          >$260 million for projects that improve equitable access</a
        >
        to benefits and
        <a
          href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/advisories/unemployment-insurance-program-letter-no-02-22"
          >$200 million for changes</a
        >
        following a consultative assessment of state workforce agencies'
        capabilities. But, many of these programs have not been rigorously
        evaluated to see if they work.

        If recipiency can change, what's happening in states with higher
        recipiency?
      </h2>
      <p class="main-text">
        There's a lot of theories about why recipiency varies so much. In recent
        years, academic research has looked at how to improve access to
        benefits. There's a lot of approaches that states have tried in
        administering the program and also a lot of differences in policy. This
        patchwork of policy and implementation has led to some outcomes that
        look like a lot of American history and politics.
      </p>
      <img
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m-rosenbaum/CAPP-30239-Static/refs/heads/main/static_final/c6.svg"
        alt="A map of state recipiency rates"
      />
      <p class="main-text">
        Northern states have tended to make it easier to get unemployment
        insurance benefits, and as such have better recipiency rates. These
        differences are likely caused by lower take-up and more constrictive
        policy. Black potential claimants, in particular,
        <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29595">take up benefits less</a>
        than other potential claimants, especially in the South.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        But states also vary over time. If we look at the bigger states from
        earlier, we can see how often they have a certain recipiency rate for
        each month they report it. If a rate is more common, that rate will be a
        larger bump in the graph below. If a state's recipiency rate doesn't
        change much in the past two decades, it would be a really tall bump. If
        the state's changed a lot, it would spread out.
      </p>

      <p class="main-text">
        What's happening in New Jersey? Over the past two decades, New Jersey
        has had a lot of differences in its recipiency rate. The answer is a
        combination of policy and implementation. Alongside some changes to
        unemployment insurance law, the New Jersey Office of Innovation worked
        with NJ DOL to modernize their system with a focus on making it easier
        to use for residents. Since 2022,
        <a href="https://innovation.nj.gov/projects/ui-application-redesign/"
          >NJ DOL has had</a
        >
        a new app, SMS reminders, mobile-accessibility, and plain language
        descriptions of the law. The impacts are striking. UI is easier to
        access, and you can see it in the recipiency rate.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        That gets us back to the original question: How many people miss out on
        unemployment insurance? We can't necessarily get that answer and
        certainly can't use the recipiency rate to get. One solution would be to
        get better information on who isn't getting benefits. A better
        recipiency rate would help states make decisions to help their
        residents. Turning the lights on in a dark room lets you navigate to
        where you want to go.
      </p>
      <p class="main-text">
        Even if the recipiency rate is a flawed measure at best, states can
        still figure out how to make sure that the people who have paid into
        unemployment insurance actually get their benefits. New Jersey has done
        it. And New Jersey is an indication that when they do, we can see it in
        the recipiency rate.
